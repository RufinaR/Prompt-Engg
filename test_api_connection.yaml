      hope this email finds you well. My name is Tim Smith and I have been a customer
      of JoeSoft for several years now. Recently, I encountered an issue with your
      product that I was hoping you could help me resolve.\\n\\nThe problem I am having
      is with the installation and use of your software. I have been using your software
      for a number of years on both Mac and PC computers. Recently, after completing
      the installation process, I can\u2019t seem to use the software. When I try
      to open the application, I keep getting an error message that says \u201CThe
      application could not be opened.\u201D I have uninstalled and re-installed the
      software several times to no avail.\\n\\nI was wondering if you could provide
      me with any help or advice about this problem. Is there any way I can troubleshoot
      this issue so I can get the software working properly? If not, is there any
      way I can get a refund or credit for the software?\\n\\nAny help or advice you
      could provide would be much appreciated.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nTim Smith\",\n

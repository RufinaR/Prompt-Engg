      investigating why and how things work. To do this, scientists use scientific
      methods such as collecting data, forming hypotheses, designing experiments,
      and analyzing the results.\\n\\nTo start out as a research scientist, it would
      be important to first choose an area of interest and become an expert on it.
      Then, an important step would be to learn the basics of research \u2014 the
      empirical method and scientific methodologies. This includes reading up on the
      topic, finding reliable sources, and having an open mind. Doing this will help
      you build the critical skills needed to become an expert researcher.\\n\\nOnce
      you have the basics, the next thing to do would be to plan your research. Start
      by reading as much as you can on the topic and forming a hypothesis \u2014 a
      proposed solution to a problem or an explanation of some phenomenon. From your
      hypothesis, generate questions and ask yourself what methods can be used to
      test these hypotheses. Now that you have a sense of what you are trying to achieve,
      create a research plan with the data collection methods you intend to use and
      how you plan to analyze the data to support your hypothesis.\\n\\nFinally, after
      collecting data and analyzing the results, it\u2019s time to write up your findings
      and results. This involves writing a paper that is composed of an introduction,
      a literature review, a methodology section, the results of your research, and
      a conclusion.\\n\\nThese steps outline the basics of the research process, but
      the journey does not end here. Research is an ongoing process \u2014 knowledge
      is always in flux and new questions and ideas are always being proposed. As
      such, it\u2019s important to keep your finger on the pulse of new research being
      done in your field and stay up-to-date with new developments. \\n\\nCitation:

Albert Einstein's theory of relativity comprises two distinct yet related theories: Special Relativity and General Relativity.

1. Special Relativity (1905):
This theory deals with inertial frames moving uniformly relative to each other. Its fundamental principles are:

Uniformity of physical laws in all inertial frames.
Constant speed of light in a vacuum, irrespective of motion.
It introduced revolutionary ideas like Time Dilation, Length Contraction, Relativity of Simultaneity, and the famous Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mcÂ²).
2. General Relativity (1915):
This theory, a conceptual leap from Newton's law of universal gravitation, defines gravity as spacetime curvature influenced by mass and energy. Its core concepts are:

Spacetime curvature directed by mass/energy distribution.
Spacetime as a unified four-dimensional continuum.
Gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, black holes, and universe expansion as key phenomena.
Both theories, extensively verified, highlight profound cosmic insights yet remain at odds with quantum mechanics, indicating the need for a unified theory.

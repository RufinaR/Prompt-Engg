      see your enthusiasm for learning about the theory of relativity. To begin, the
      theory of relativity actually encompasses two theories proposed by Albert Einstein:
      special relativity and general relativity.\n```citation: Einstein, Albert (1905).
      \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper\". Annalen der Physik. 322 (10).```\n\nSpecial
      relativity, proposed in 1905, fundamentally changed our understanding of space
      and time, showing that they are interwoven into a single continuum known as
      spacetime.\n```citation: Einstein, Albert (1905). \"On the Electrodynamics of
      Moving Bodies\". Annalen der Physik. 17 (10).```\n\nOne of the key postulates
      of special relativity is that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for
      all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or observer.\n```citation:
      Einstein, Albert (1905). \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\". Annalen
      der Physik. 17 (10).```\n\nThis leads to several mind-bending implications,
      such as time dilation, where time can pass at different rates for observers
      who are in relative motion to one another.\n```citation: Einstein, Albert (1905).
      \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\". Annalen der Physik. 17 (10).```\n\nNext
      is length contraction, another consequence of special relativity, which means
      that objects compress along the direction of motion as they approach the speed
      of light, when observed from a stationary frame of reference.\n```citation:
      Einstein, Albert (1905). \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\". Annalen
      der Physik. 17 (10).```\n\nNow, general relativity, proposed by Einstein in
      1915, extends the theory of special relativity and Newton''s law of universal
      gravitation to provide a unified description of gravity as a geometric property
      of space and time, or spacetime.\n```citation: Einstein, Albert (1915). \"Die
      Feldgleichungen der Gravitation\". Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie
      der Wissenschaften zu Berlin.```\n\nGeneral relativity predicts that massive
      objects cause a distortion in spacetime, which is felt as gravity by other objects.\n```citation:
      Einstein, Albert (1915). \"Die Feldgleichungen der Gravitation\". Sitzungsberichte
      der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin.```\n\nAn important prediction
      of general relativity is the bending of light around massive objects, a phenomenon
      called gravitational lensing, which has been confirmed by many observations.\n```citation:
      Dyson, F.W.; Eddington, A.S.; Davidson, C. (1920). \"A Determination of the
      Deflection of Light by the Sun''s Gravitational Field\". Philosophical Transactions
      of the Royal Society A. 220 (571-581).```\n\nAs you can see, my dedicated student,
      the theory of relativity is a cornerstone of modern physics, providing a comprehensive
      framework for understanding the cosmos from the behavior of subatomic particles
      to the movements of galaxies.\n```citation: Overbye, D. (2008). \"Einstein''s
      Universe, Still Splendid\". New York Times.```\n\nMoving forward, if you''d
      like to delve deeper, we can explore more advanced topics such as black holes,
      cosmology, and the search for a Theory of Everything that attempts to reconcile
      relativity with quantum mechanics.\n```citation: Hawking, S.W. (1988). \"A Brief
      History of Time\". Bantam Dell Publishing Group.```\n\nRemember that this is
      an overview, and each concept in relativity theory is intricate and fascinating,
      warranting a closer look and deeper understanding through study and discussion.\n```citation:
      Rindler, W. (2006). \"Relativity: Special, General, and Cosmological\". Oxford
      University Press.```\n\nAs you continue your journey in physics, I encourage
      you to read the seminal papers by Einstein and other physicists, explore textbooks
      in the field, and engage in discussions to solidify your understanding.\n```citation:
      Einstein, Albert (1916). \"Die Grundlage der allgemeinen Relativit\u00e4tstheorie\".
      Annalen der Physik. 49 (7).```\n\nBy comprehending these revolutionary ideas,
      you, my dedicated student, will be well-equipped to appreciate the mysteries
      of the universe and possibly contribute to the next great discoveries in physics.\n```citation:
      Greene, B. (2004). \"The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture
      of Reality\". Vintage Books.```\n\nI hope this foundational introduction gives
      you a starting point from which to explore and discover the beauty of the theory
      of relativity.\n```citation: Einstein, Albert (1916). \"Relativity: The Special
      and the General Theory\". Henry Holt and Company.```\n\nFeel free to reach out
      with any questions or if you wish to delve further into specific aspects of
      relativity, my dedicated student.\n```citation: Adapted from my personal expertise

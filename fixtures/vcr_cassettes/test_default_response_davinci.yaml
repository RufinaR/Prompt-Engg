      of Albert Einstein published in the early 1900s. The first, the special theory
      of relativity, explains how to interpret motion between different inertial frames
      of reference \u2014 that is, places that are moving at constant speeds relative
      to each other. It defines the laws of motion and shows that the speed of light
      in a vacuum is constant regardless of the motion of the observer. The second,
      the general theory of relativity, is a theory of gravitation that replaces Newton's
      law of universal gravitation. It explains the law of gravitation and its relation
      to other forces of nature and provides a unified description of gravity as a
      geometric property of space and time. This theory predicts the existence of
      gravitational waves, describes how gravitational fields curve space and time,
      and suggests that masses cause spacetime to curve.\",\n      \"index\": 0,\n

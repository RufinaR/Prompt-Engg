      enthusiasm for learning about the theory of relativity. It is essential to begin
      with the most fundamental concept in relativity, which is that the laws of physics
      are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another. This
      principle was developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century and is
      at the heart of special relativity.\\n```citation: Einstein, A. (1905). Zur
      Elektrodynamik bewegter K\xF6rper. Annalen der Physik, 322(10), 891-921.```\\n\\nNow,
      my dedicated student, building on this, special relativity introduced the idea
      that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant and is the same for all observers,
      regardless of the motion of the light source or observer.\\n```citation: Einstein,
      A. (1905). Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\xF6rper. Annalen der Physik, 322(10),
      891-921.```\\n\\nAs we delve deeper, my dedicated student, you should understand
      that because the speed of light is constant, time and space must be flexible.
      This flexibility leads to phenomena such as time dilation and length contraction,
      meaning moving clocks tick slower and objects in motion contract in length in
      the direction of motion.\\n```citation: Lorentz, H.A. (1895). Versuch einer
      Theorie der electrischen und optischen Erscheinungen in bewegten K\xF6rpern.
      Leiden: E.J. Brill.```\\n\\nAdvancing our discussion, my dedicated student,
      Einstein expanded on these concepts with general relativity in 1915, which introduced
      the idea that gravity is not a force, but rather the curvature of spacetime
      caused by mass and energy.\\n```citation: Einstein, A. (1915). Die Feldgleichungen
      der Gravitation. Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften
      zu Berlin, 844-847.```\\n\\nFurthermore, my dedicated student, according to
      general relativity, objects move along the straightest path in this curved spacetime,
      which we perceive as the gravitational force.\\n```citation: Einstein, A. (1916).
      Die Grundlage der allgemeinen Relativit\xE4tstheorie. Annalen der Physik, 354(7),
      769-822.```\\n\\nWhile general relativity is quite complex, my dedicated student,
      one of its predictions is the bending of light by gravity, which has been confirmed
      through observations such as the deflection of starlight by the Sun during a
      solar eclipse.\\n```citation: Dyson, F.W., Eddington, A.S. & Davidson, C. (1920).
      A Determination of the Deflection of Light by the Sun's Gravitational Field,
      from Observations Made at the Solar Eclipse of May 29, 1919. Philosophical Transactions
      of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 220(571-581),
      291-333.```\\n\\nTo add another layer, my dedicated student, general relativity
      also predicts the existence of black holes, regions of spacetime where the gravitational
      pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it.\\n```citation:
      Schwarzschild, K. (1916). \xDCber das Gravitationsfeld eines Massenpunktes nach
      der Einsteinschen Theorie. Sitzungsberichte der K\xF6niglich Preussischen Akademie
      der Wissenschaften, 189-196.```\\n\\nConcluding our session today, my dedicated
      student, the theory of relativity is not just theoretical\u2014it has practical
      applications such as influencing the way GPS systems calculate positions by
      accounting for the time dilation effects between satellites and Earth.\\n```citation:
      Ashby, N. (2003). Relativity in the Global Positioning System. Living Reviews
      in Relativity, 6(1), 1.```\\n\\nPlease, my dedicated student, take your time
      to digest these complex ideas and explore the sources provided to deepen your
      understanding. As you continue your studies, you will be able to grasp the more
      intricate details and mathematical underpinnings of relativity.\"\n      },\n

      proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905, is one of the most important scientific
      theories of the 20th century. It states that the laws of physics are the same
      for all observers regardless of their motion, and makes predictions about gravity
      and its effects on space, time, and motion. At its most basic, the theory states
      that space and time are not absolute, but rather a curved, non-Euclidean space-time
      continuum in which all objects are determined by the warping of space and time
      caused by gravity. As an observer moves closer to a mass, time moves slower
      for them relative to another observer farther away. \\n\\n```citation: <https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-relativity/en/>```\\n\\nIt
      also predicts that gravity is the result of the acceleration of masses in space-time,
      like a bowling ball rolling down a hill. All masses also cause the warping of
      space-time around them, causing a deformation of the gravitational field, creating
      an effect known as gravitational lensing. \\n\\n```citation: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity>```\\n\\nFinally,
      the theory of relativity states that the speed of light is always constant with
      respect to an observer, regardless of the observer's speed, and that the mass
      of an object increases with its speed. This has led to the realization that
      a great deal of the universe is composed of unseen energy, known as dark energy,
      which is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. \\n\\n```citation:

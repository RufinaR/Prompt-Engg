      is the idea that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of
      reference. This means that no matter how you are moving, all observations of
      physical phenomena should be the same. This theory was put forward by Albert
      Einstein, a German physicist, in the early 20th century. It was a revolutionary
      change in the way we think about physics, because it showed that things like
      time and space could be distorted and warped due to the presence of gravity.\\n\\nCitation:

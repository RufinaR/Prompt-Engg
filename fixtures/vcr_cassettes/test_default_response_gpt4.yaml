      to two related theories proposed by Albert Einstein: Special Relativity and
      General Relativity.\\n\\n**1. Special Relativity (1905):**\\nEinstein's theory
      of Special Relativity addresses frames of reference that are moving at constant
      speeds relative to one another (i.e., inertial frames). The theory postulates
      that:\\n\\n- The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. No physical
      experiment (without looking outside) can detect constant velocity.\\n- The speed
      of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion
      of the light source or observer.\\n\\nSpecial Relativity introduced several
      revolutionary concepts:\\n\\n- Time Dilation: An observer moving relative to
      a clock will measure the clock ticking slower than it would if the observer
      and the clock were at rest with respect to one another (this effect has been
      observed in precise experiments with atomic clocks, for example).\\n- Length
      Contraction: Objects moving relative to an observer will be measured to be shortened
      in the direction of motion (though this effect is only noticeable at speeds
      approaching that of light).\\n- Relativity of Simultaneity: Events that are
      simultaneous in one frame of reference may not be simultaneous in another moving
      frame of reference.\\n- Mass-Energy Equivalence: Perhaps the most famous equation
      in physics, E=mc\xB2, arises from Special Relativity, stating that mass (m)
      and energy (E) are equivalent, with c (the speed of light) as the proportionality
      constant. That means an object gains energy as it gains velocity, and that energy
      is equivalent to an increase in mass.\\n\\n**2. General Relativity (1915):**\\nEinstein's
      theory of General Relativity is a theory of gravitation that replaced Newton's
      law of universal gravitation. It describes gravity not as a force, but as the
      curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. According to General Relativity:\\n\\n-
      Mass/energy tells space how to curve, and the curvature of space tells mass
      how to move.\\n- Time alongside the three dimensions of space are interwoven
      into a single four-dimensional fabric called spacetime.\\n- Massive objects
      cause a distortion in spacetime, which is felt as gravity. The more massive
      an object, the more it warps the space around it.\\n- Time also dilates in a
      gravitational field, known as gravitational time dilation. Clocks closer to
      a massive body ticks slower than those further away.\\n\\nGeneral Relativity
      has been confirmed by numerous experiments and observations. One of its most
      famous predictions is the bending of light around massive objects, known as
      gravitational lensing, which has been observed astronomically. It also predicts
      exotic phenomena such as black holes and the expansion of the universe, both
      of which have strong observational support.\\n\\nBoth Special and General Relativity
      have profound implications for our understanding of the universe and have been
      confirmed by many experiments and observations to date. However, it should be
      noted that relativity remains incompatible with quantum mechanics, and a grand
      unified theory that can reconcile both large-scale gravity and quantum effects
      has yet to be formulated.\"\n      },\n      \"logprobs\": null,\n      \"finish_reason\":

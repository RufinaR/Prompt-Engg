      comprised of two theories proposed by Albert Einstein: the special theory of
      relativity and the general theory of relativity.\\n\\n**Special Theory of Relativity
      (1905):**\\n\\nThe special theory of relativity postulates two main ideas:\\n\\n1.
      The laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, which means
      the laws of physics apply equally and universally, regardless of the observer's
      constant velocity.\\n\\n2. The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all
      observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or observer. This speed
      is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second and is considered an ultimate
      constant; nothing can travel faster.\\n\\nFrom these two postulates, Einstein
      derived several groundbreaking conclusions:\\n\\n- Time Dilation: Time is not
      absolute and can pass at different rates for different observers. Objects in
      motion relative to an observer will experience time more slowly than those that
      are at rest with respect to that observer.\\n\\n- Length Contraction (Lorentz
      Contraction): Objects appear to contract along the direction of motion as they
      approach the speed of light.\\n\\n- Mass-Energy Equivalence: Energy and mass
      are interchangeable, which is expressed in the famous equation E=mc\xB2, where
      E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light. This implies that as an
      object's speed increases, its mass effectively does as well, making it require
      more energy to accelerate further.\\n\\n- Relativity of Simultaneity: Two events
      that appear simultaneous to an observer in one frame of reference may not appear
      simultaneous to an observer in a different frame of reference.\\n\\n**General
      Theory of Relativity (1915):**\\n\\nThe general theory of relativity extends
      the principles of special relativity to include acceleration and gravity. It
      is a theory of gravitation that describes gravity not as a force (as in Newtonian
      mechanics) but as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the
      presence of mass and energy.\\n\\nThe key ideas in general relativity are:\\n\\n-
      Equivalence Principle: The effects of being in a gravitational field and being
      in an accelerating frame of reference are locally indistinguishable.\\n\\n-
      Spacetime Curvature: Matter tells spacetime how to curve, and curved spacetime
      tells matter how to move. Massive objects like planets and stars actually warp
      the spacetime around them, and this curvature affects how objects move through
      space.\\n\\n- Geodesics: Objects free from other forces move along paths in
      spacetime called geodesics, which can be thought of as the \\\"straightest possible\\\"
      paths in a curved spacetime.\\n\\nGeneral relativity has numerous experimental
      confirmations, such as the precession of Mercury's orbit and the bending of
      light around massive objects, known as gravitational lensing. One of the most
      significant predictions of general relativity was the existence of gravitational
      waves, which were directly detected by the LIGO observatory in 2015.\\n\\nTogether,
      special and general relativity form the cornerstone of modern physics and have
      led to a deeper understanding of how the universe works, from the behavior of
      subatomic particles to the movements of galaxies.\"\n      },\n      \"logprobs\":

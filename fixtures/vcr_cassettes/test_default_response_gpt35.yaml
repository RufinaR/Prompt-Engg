      physicist Albert Einstein, is a fundamental theory in physics that revolutionized
      our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It consists of two main parts:
      the special theory of relativity and the general theory of relativity.\\n\\n1.
      Special Theory of Relativity:\\nThe special theory of relativity, published
      in 1905, deals with objects moving at constant speeds relative to each other,
      and provides a new understanding of space and time. Its key postulates are as
      follows:\\n\\n- The laws of physics are the same in all inertial (non-accelerating)
      reference frames. This means that the fundamental laws and principles of physics
      are not affected by an observer's constant velocity.\\n\\n- The speed of light
      in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of their relative motion.
      This is denoted by the symbol 'c' and has a value of approximately 299,792,458
      meters per second.\\n\\nBased on these principles, the theory introduces two
      important concepts:\\n\\n- Time Dilation: According to special relativity, time
      is not absolute and can vary depending on the relative motion between observers.
      When an object moves at high speeds relative to a stationary observer, time
      will appear to pass more slowly for the moving object. This effect is known
      as time dilation.\\n\\n- Length Contraction: Special relativity also predicts
      that objects moving at high speeds relative to an observer will appear shorter
      in the direction of motion. This contraction is called length contraction.\\n\\nMoreover,
      the theory of special relativity introduces the famous equation: E=mc\xB2, which
      states that energy (E) and mass (m) are interchangeable, and the speed of light
      squared (c\xB2) acts as the conversion factor between the two.\\n\\n2. General
      Theory of Relativity:\\nThe general theory of relativity, published in 1915,
      expands upon the special theory by incorporating gravity into the framework.
      It explains gravity as the curvature of space-time caused by the presence of
      mass and energy. The main postulate of general relativity is:\\n\\n- Mass and
      energy curve the fabric of space-time, and objects move along the resulting
      curves shaped by this curvature.\\n\\nIn simpler terms, objects with mass create
      a gravitational field that warps the space and time around them. This curvature
      influences the motion of other objects and is responsible for the force of gravity.\\n\\nGeneral
      relativity predicts several phenomena, including:\\n\\n- Gravitational time
      dilation: Clocks in a gravitational field tick slower compared to those in a
      weaker field or in space.\\n\\n- Gravitational lensing: Mass can bend the path
      of light, causing it to curve when passing near massive objects. This effect
      leads to the phenomenon of lensing, where distant objects appear distorted or
      magnified.\\n\\n- Gravitational waves: Accelerating massive objects can produce
      ripples in the fabric of space-time, known as gravitational waves. These waves
      were directly observed for the first time in 2015.\\n\\nOverall, the theory
      of relativity has shaped our understanding of the universe, challenging and
      expanding upon classical Newtonian physics. Its predictions have been extensively
      tested and confirmed through various experiments and observations, making it
      one of the most successful scientific theories ever developed.\"\n      },\n

      is a complex concept, but can be broken down into two main principles. The first
      is the special theory of relativity, which was first proposed by Albert Einstein
      in 1905. This theory states that the laws of physics remain unchanged in all
      inertial frames, or frames of reference that move with constant velocity relative
      to each other. It also states that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same,
      regardless of the reference frame. This means that time and space can be observed
      differently by two observers in different inertial frames. \\n\\nFollowing this,
      Einstein proposed the general theory of relativity in 1915, which extended on
      the principles of the special theory of relativity. This includes the idea of
      curved spacetime, or the idea that the presence of mass or energy can warps
      and bends the fabric of the universe. This is also where the famous equation
      of E = MC^2 comes from, which explains the relationship between matter and energy.

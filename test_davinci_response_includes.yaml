      originally formulated by Albert Einstein in 1905, is the idea that all motion
      must be defined relative to a chosen frame of reference. This means that no
      matter how fast something is moving, if there is no absolute reference point,
      it cannot be determined whether it is moving or not. In other words, all motion
      is relative to the observer. \\n\\nThe Theory of Relativity states that the
      laws of physics are the same for all observers in all inertial frames of reference.
      This can further be broken down into two main principles: the Principle of Relativity,
      which states that all the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames,
      and the Principle of Invariance, which states that the laws of physics do not
      change when going from one frame of reference to another.\\n\\nAnother important
      concept in the Theory of Relativity is the idea of space-time. Space-time is
      a 4-dimensional construct that combines three dimensions of space and one dimension
      of time. According to the Theory of Relativity, space-time is curved and this
      has an effect on the way objects move through it. \\n\\nThe Theory of Relativity
      is an incredibly complex and powerful theory that is still being explored and
      studied today.\\n\\nCitation: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity>\",\n

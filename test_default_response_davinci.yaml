      that explains the relationship between space and time, as well as the motion
      of matter and energy. It is based on two fundamental principles: the principle
      of relativity and the principle of equivalence. The principle of relativity
      states that the laws of physics are the same in all non-accelerating frames
      of reference, regardless of their motion relative to each other. The principle
      of equivalence states that the effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable
      from each other. From these two principles follows that all observers will measure
      the same laws of physics regardless of their motion or environment. This has
      allowed scientists to develop a mathematical description of the universe and
      its contents, resulting in a more accurate view of the laws of physics. The
      theory also provides a mathematical framework for many scientific advancements,
      such as GPS systems, quantum mechanics, and black holes.\",\n      \"index\":

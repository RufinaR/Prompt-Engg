      in physics, proposed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century, that revolutionized
      our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It consists of two parts: the
      special theory of relativity and the general theory of relativity.\\n\\nThe
      special theory of relativity, proposed in 1905, states that the laws of physics
      are the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. It introduces
      the concept of \\\"spacetime,\\\" which combines the three dimensions of space
      with the dimension of time into a four-dimensional framework. The theory also
      asserts that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless
      of their relative motion. This means that the passage of time, the length of
      objects, and the energy of an object depend on its relative motion to other
      observers.\\n\\nOne of the key consequences of the special theory of relativity
      is the concept of time dilation. It suggests that time passes differently for
      observers in relative motion. For example, if two observers are moving relative
      to each other, one moving at a high velocity, time will appear to pass slower
      for the moving observer compared to the stationary one.\\n\\nThe general theory
      of relativity, proposed in 1915, expands upon the special theory by incorporating
      the influence of gravity. It states that gravity is not just a force, but rather
      the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. According
      to this theory, objects with mass or energy deform the fabric of spacetime,
      causing other objects to move along curved paths. This is often explained using
      the analogy of a heavy ball placed on a rubber sheet, causing it to bend and
      objects rolling nearby to follow curved paths.\\n\\nThe general theory of relativity
      also predicts phenomena such as gravitational time dilation, where time appears
      to pass slower in the presence of a strong gravitational field, and the deflection
      of light by gravity. It has been confirmed by numerous experiments and observations,
      including the bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse.\\n\\nOverall,
      the theory of relativity provides a unified framework for understanding the
      behavior of the physical world at both small and large scales, and has had profound
      implications for our understanding of the universe and its workings.\"\n      },\n
